# About DevTools

## Highlights

* [Inactive CSS](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefox-70-a-bountiful-release-for-all/#developertools):
 Firefox DevTools now grays out CSS declarations that don’t have an effect on the page. When you hover over the info icon, you’ll see a useful message about why the CSS is not being applied, including a hint about how to fix the problem.
